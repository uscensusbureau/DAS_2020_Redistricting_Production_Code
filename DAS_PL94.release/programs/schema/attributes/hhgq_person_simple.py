"""
Simplified Householder/GQType attribute for person universe schemas, with only 7 GQ levels, and no vacant units (since, its for person, not units).
Used in PL94 (and closely related) schemas as well as in Person part of the Demonstration Product.
Thus is outdated.
For 2020 Final product, use HHGQAttr in hhgq.py for household/unit universe, and RelGQAttr in relgq.py for person universe.
