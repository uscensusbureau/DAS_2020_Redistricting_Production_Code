Items needed for the March 28 release:
- [x] Ability to make source code distribuitions
- [ ] Final Source code distribution
- [ ] README file explaining the source code and how to run it.
- [ ] Text output showing a run of the source code on EMR with a single executor (because our users will likely only have a single Gurobi license)

- [ ] Text of press release. It should say why we are doing it, and note that questions will be answered on GitHub using the "issues" feature.
